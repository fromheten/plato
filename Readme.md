*The intergalactic programming environment*

## What is this?
A programming envrionment & language where every expression has a unique ID, which is it's hash.

When referring to expressions by their hash rather than by a name, all expressions have a unique ID.

This means you can be free to treat the entire Earth - nay, the entire universe - as one namespace.

## TODO

- [x] Read and write expressions into a text language (from which the ID will later be derived)
- [ ] Evaluate an expression
- [ ] Type check an expression (or the functions in it)
- [ ] Create the runtime that can do effects when given commands
